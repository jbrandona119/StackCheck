# The Problem

I need to create a webpage that will show each object from the json blob provided in a paged interface.

## Requirements Given

The only requirement provided was to make the webpage displaying that information using any technology, styling etc.

### Solution

I will be using React (create-react-app) to create a simple, smooth functioning webpage that will display the information in an easily readable and understandable way. A stretch goal will be to get a MongoDB connected and have the app deployed to Heroku.

### Final Thoughts

Unfortunately, things got a bit hectic this weekend and I couldn't put in as much effort as I would've liked. It is a functioning app that meets the requirements so I think that counts. Please feel free to message me with any questions or concerns!

#### Known Issues

* When searching for a client, you must first click the "See All Clients" button, then you can start typing in a name

* If you start typing in a name, then you click the "See All Clients" button, nothing will appear
